# DrobBoxNodeJs
The goal for this week's assignment is to build a Dropbox Clone, which is a fancy way of saying a directory that exists in multiple locations that is kept in sync to be a perfect mirror. If a file is added to the server directory, it should get pushed to the client and appear in the client's directory.
